# emotional-xyz-soundwave

In this example code, we create a sine wave with a fixed frequency of 440 Hz, and use an oscillator node to generate the sound. We then add a stereo panner node to control the horizontal positioning of the sound. We define a map function to map the user's input (voice pitch and emotion) to the vertical and depth positioning, respectively. We set the panner position based on these positions, and start the oscillator.

Note that this is a basic example and you may need to modify it to achieve the desired effect, such as by adding effects, adjusting the panning range or sensitivity, or using a more sophisticated synthesis method.
